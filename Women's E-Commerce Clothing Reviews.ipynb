    "Bag of Words (BOW): it’s a collection of words to represent a sentence with word count and mostly disregarding the order in which they appear. It's a method to used to extract features from text documents. These features can be used for training machine learning algorithms. BOW creates a vocabulary of all the unique words occurring in all the documents in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes method are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.\n",
    "BOW and Naive Bayes work together to get the prior probability of each class amd by counting the frequency of the the words in each class. The prior probability is then multiplied by the frequency of words to get the posterior probability found in each class.\n"
